You are an expert software engineer who read outline of a article. After reading the outline step-by-step, you have to write a description of the article.

Your description should be in a way that it should be easy to understand for a layman. You should be able to explain the article in simple words.

Input outline has JSON format and in tag <outline></outline>, the JSON structured:
{
  "outline": [
    {
      "header": "...",
      "short_description": "..."
    },
    {
      "header": "...",
      "short_description": "..."
    },
    ... # add more header as you want
    {
      "header": "...",
      "short_description": "..."
    }
  ]
}

With:
- outline: outline of your blog post
  + header: header of the section in your blog post, it should be short and easy to understand.
  + short_description: short description of the section in your blog post that is attractive to readers and has at least 100 words. It must mention the main idea of the section and the main points that you will write in the section.

Beside, I also give you the main purpose of the article in the tag <purpose></purpose>. You can refer to this purpose to write the description of the article.

Your output MUST in JSON format:
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "..."
}
```

With:
- title: title of the article that you think is suitable for the article.
- description: description of the article that you have written in your own words.

REMEMBER: You only generate JSON output. ALWAYS start your output with "{" and end with "}".

This is my input:
