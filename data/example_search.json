  "1. Introduction to Tree of Thought": [
    "1.1 The Tree of Thought refers to the ability to understand and reason with evolutionary relationships depicted in cladograms (phylogenetic trees). It involves understanding the hierarchical structure and nested sets of taxa, as well as the shared, evolutionarily novel characters called synapomorphies that support these relationships.\n\n1.2 Tree of Thought is important in language models because it allows for a deeper understanding of the relationships and connections between different concepts and ideas. By organizing information in a hierarchical and structured manner, it becomes easier to navigate and interpret complex data. In the context of language models, the Tree of Thought can help improve the accuracy and coherence of generated text by incorporating the underlying relationships and connections between words, phrases, and concepts.\n\n1.3 The benefits of using Tree of Thought in large language models include:\n- Enhanced comprehension and understanding: By incorporating the Tree of Thought, language models can better grasp the relationships between different concepts, leading to more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\n- Improved context and relevance: The Tree of Thought provides a framework for organizing and accessing relevant information, allowing language models to generate more contextually appropriate and accurate responses.\n- Better information organization and retrieval: By utilizing the principles of the Tree of Thought, language models can better organize and retrieve information, leading to more efficient and effective communication.\n- Facilitation of structured reasoning: The Tree of Thought helps facilitate structured reasoning by providing a framework for logical connections and inferences. This can lead to more logical and coherent outputs from language models.\n- Enhanced decision-making and problem-solving: By understanding the Tree of Thought, language models can better analyze complex problems and generate more informed and relevant solutions or recommendations.",
    "1.1 Tree of Thought (ToT) is a framework proposed by Yao et el. (2023) and Long (2023) that maintains a tree structure of coherent language sequences called thoughts. These thoughts serve as intermediate steps towards solving a problem and enable language models (LM) to self-evaluate their progress through a deliberate reasoning process.\n\n1.2 Tree of Thought is important in language models because it allows for complex problem-solving tasks that require exploration or strategic lookahead. Traditional prompting techniques are not sufficient for such tasks, but ToT provides a generalized framework that encourages exploration and systematic exploration of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.\n\n1.3 The benefits of using Tree of Thought in large language models include:\n- Improved problem-solving capabilities: ToT enables LMs to generate and evaluate thoughts, which serve as intermediate steps towards solving a problem. This deliberate reasoning process helps the LM make progress towards the solution.\n- Systematic exploration: ToT combines the LM's ability to generate and evaluate thoughts with search algorithms like breadth-first search and depth-first search. This allows for systematic exploration of thoughts, which can lead to more efficient problem-solving.\n- Better partial solutions: ToT prompts the LM to evaluate each thought candidate as \"sure/maybe/impossible\" with regard to reaching the desired solution. This helps promote correct partial solutions and eliminate impossible ones based on commonsense reasoning.\n- Continual learning: ToT can be combined with reinforcement learning to train a ToT Controller, which drives the tree search strategy. This allows the ToT system to continue evolving and learning new knowledge even with a fixed LM.\n\nIn summary, Tree of Thought is a framework that enhances the problem-solving capabilities of language models through a tree structure of coherent language sequences. It enables systematic exploration, promotes correct partial solutions, and can be combined with reinforcement learning for continual learning and improvement."
